title: Algorithm Design
summary: Real world problems in need of a solution are first designed and transformed into entities that a machine can recognize and solve. This is the most creative part of problem solving activities. A good design leads to algorithms that are accurate, efficient and scalable 
description: Designing algorithms is what I have been doing in the last 10 years and more. I can set up data analytics solutions for small and large enterprises and apply machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and trends, extract knowledge and support decisions within several commercial domains, from finance, healthcare, traffic, and sales forecasting. I design and deploy algorithms and cloud-based software systems for production environments with high industrial standards. Feel free to schedule a meeting with me
